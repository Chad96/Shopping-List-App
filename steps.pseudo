Step 1: Initialize the Project
    -Create a new React project.
    - Use npm create vite@latest to set up the initial project structure.
    - Install necessary dependencies.
    -Install libraries such as react, redux, react-router-dom, and json-server.
    -Set up version control.
    -Initialize a Git repository and make the first commit.


Step 2: Plan the Project
    -Design the user interface.
    -Create a moodboard for inspiration and design ideas.
    -Outline the logic.
    -Break down the application functionality into smaller, manageable parts.
    -Write pseudocode.
    -Draft pseudocode for each major function or component to guide development.


Step 3: Set Up JSON Server
    -Create a JSON database file.
    -Example: db.json to hold initial data for shopping lists.
    -Configure the JSON server.
    -Add scripts in package.json to start the JSON server during development.

    
Step 4: Create Reusable Components
    -Develop the Login component.
    -Build a user login interface.
    -Develop the Register component.
    -Create a registration form for new users.
    -Develop the Home component.
    -Design the main page to display shopping lists.
    -Develop the Profile component.
    -Provide a page for users to manage their profiles.
    -Develop the ShoppingList component.
    -Create a component to display individual shopping list items.
    -Develop the ShoppingListForm component.
    -Build a form for adding and updating shopping lists.


Step 5: Implement User Management
    -Implement user registration.
    -Include fields for email, password, name, surname, and cell number.
    -Implement user login.
    -Handle user authentication with encrypted credentials.
    -Set up protected routes.
    -Restrict access to certain pages based on user authentication status.
    -Implement profile management.
    -Allow users to view and update their profile details.

    
Step 6: Implement Shopping List Management
    -Add functionality to create new shopping lists.
    -Users should be able to add a new list with name, quantity, notes, category, and images.
    -Display existing shopping lists.
    -Provide a way for users to view all their shopping lists.
    -Enable editing of shopping lists.
    -Allow users to update details of existing lists.
    -Allow deletion of shopping lists.
    -Implement functionality for users to delete lists they no longer need.
    -Add search functionality.
    -Users should be able to search for specific items within their lists.
    -Implement sorting options.
    -Allow users to sort lists by name, category, or date added.
    -Classify items with categories or tags.
    -Use categories to help organize items within the lists.


Step 7: Manage State with Redux
    -Set up the Redux store.
    -Create a store to hold the application’s state.
    -Define Redux actions.
    -Write actions for adding, reading, updating, and deleting shopping lists.
    -Create Redux reducers.
    -Develop reducers to handle changes to the state based on actions.
    -Connect components to the Redux store.
    -Ensure that components receive and update data from the store.


Step 8: Ensure Responsiveness and Accessibility
    -Make the app responsive.
    -Use CSS and media queries to ensure the app works on various screen sizes.
    -Implement accessibility features.
    -Focus on keyboard navigation, screen reader support, and clear focus states.
    -Allow users to share shopping lists.
    -Provide functionality to share lists with others, possibly via a shareable link.


Step 9: Optimize and Secure the App
    -Optimize the app’s performance.
    -Ensure the app loads quickly and runs smoothly.
    -Implement data privacy measures.
    -Secure user data and comply with relevant privacy laws.
    -Secure routes and data.
    -Protect sensitive routes and encrypt user credentials.


Step 10: Deploy and Document the Project
    -Deploy the app to a hosting platform.
    -Choose a platform like GitHub Pages, Vercel, or Netlify for deployment.
    -Document the project in the GitHub README.
    -Include instructions for setting up, running, and using the app.
    -Share the GitHub link.
Submit the project by providing the GitHub repository link.
